# python
There are several projects in that repository which I've created or been participated in some team and group assignments. 
It includes some basic syntax and little guided projects which I've collected from the courses I've taken or that I created myself.
I've been working on Python with machine learning, AI and deep learning. So these are the things I'm into and I try to get better with progress over time.
